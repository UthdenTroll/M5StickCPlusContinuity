# M5StickCPlusContinuity
Continuity Meter using M5StickCPlus and a Proto Hat (optional)

Pins are G26 and G36 - You don't have to have a proto hat - you can just have two pins with leads in the corresponding holes up top.

It beeps and screen flashes green when continuity is made. Just easy to have for my work finding faults in old tech.
